## One-time installation instructions - Windows 10/11

1. If you do not already have Python 3.X or later installed, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ to fetch the latest installer, download it, and follow installation instructions.
1. We use the `poetry` python package manager in this project. Please install poetry as follows:
    1. Open a PowerShell window.
    2. As per instructions at https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation, in the PowerShell window, type `(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://install.python-poetry.org -UseBasicParsing).Content | python -` 
        1. Heed the warning at the end of the install - you need the path to poetry added to your PATH variable in your Windows environment variables. A google search should provide you with instructions on how to do that.
